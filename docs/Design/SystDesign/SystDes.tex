\section{Introduction}

Sayyara is a progressive web application (PWA) which will act as a single platform for independent
auto repair shops and vehicle owners. This platform will allow independent auto repair shops and
vehicle owners to interact in a more efficient and effective manner. Key features include booking
appointments, tracking appointments, finding automotive shops, and getting quotes.

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to display the component decomposition of the system and provide
the user interface designs of the software being built. The implementation of the software will be
based off of the designs within this document. The MIS
\url{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf}
and MG
\url{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf}
are also created to give details to the software architecture and detailed component breakdowns for
the project.

\section{Scope}

\wss{Include a figure that show the System Context (showing the boundary between
	your system and the environment around it.)}

\subsection{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

\wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
	``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
	design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
	they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
	requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
	requirements with a password.}

\subsection{Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the graduate attribute
of Problem Analysis and Design. Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What are the limitations of your solution? Put another way, given unlimited resources, what could
	      you do to make the project better? (LO\_ProbSolutions)
	\item Give a brief overview of other design solutions you considered. What are the benefits and tradeoffs
	      of those other designs compared with the chosen design? From all the potential options, why did you
	      select documented design? (LO\_Explores)
\end{enumerate}
