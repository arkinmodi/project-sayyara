This document describes the requirements for Sayyara. The template for the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}. If you
make further modifications to the template, you should explicitly state what modifications were
made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

Independent auto repair shops do not have an efficient way of reaching and interacting with new
customers. Currently, many independent shop owners rely on word-of-mouth referrals as a main
channel to acquiring new customers. Independent auto repair shops are also spending a significant
amount of their time on administrative work such as managing appointments and providing quotes. As
a result, independent auto repair shops have a difficult time competing with larger repair shops
which have dedicated systems and services in place.

On the other hand, customers do not have an effective way to find and compare auto repair shops.
Currently, one of the only ways to compare repair shops is by manually searching or reaching out to
repair shops one-by-one. This process can often be repetitive and time-consuming.

Sayyara is a progressive web application (PWA) which will act as a single platform for independent
auto repair shops and vehicle owners. This platform will allow independent auto repair shops and
vehicle owners to interact in a more efficient and effective manner. Vehicle owners can search for
auto repair shops and services based on a variety of search filters; request quotes for service;
book, view, and manage service appointments. On the application, auto repair shop owners will have
full shop management capabilities such as: adding and managing a list of employees; managing a list
of service types and corresponding service appointment availabilities; managing store information
such as location, hours of operation, and contact information. Auto repair shop owners and
employees will be able to manage quotes, service appointments, and work orders from a single
application. Ultimately, Sayyara will significantly improve the auto repair experience for both
independent auto repair shops and vehicle owners.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of the project is Nabeel Ibrahim. Nabeel will be the point of contact throughout the
development of the project.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers of Sayyara will be independent auto repair shop owners, shop employees, and vehicle
owners who are looking for a vehicle repair or maintenance service.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders of the project are the developers, Tiny Coders, who are designing and
implementing the project.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
\emph{Description:} The product shall be built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA)\\
\emph{Rationale:} The supervisor wants the application to be a PWA\\
\emph{Fit Criterion:} The product shall be written using the Next.js PWA plugin

\emph{Description:} The product shall be able to function on a variety of devices, such as on a computer, on tablets and on most modern phones\\
\emph{Rationale:} Users will be accessing this product in a variety of scenarios, and will have access to different devices\\
\emph{Fit Criterion:} The product shall be tested to function properly on Chrome's device toolbar, which includes the following devices:
\begin{itemize}
	\item iPhone SE
	\item iPhone XR
	\item iPhone 12 Pro
	\item Pixel 5
	\item Samsung Galaxy S8+
	\item Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
	\item iPad Air
	\item iPad Mini
	\item Surface Pro 7
	\item Surface Duo
	\item Galaxy Fold
	\item Samsung Galaxy A51/71
	\item Nest Hub
	\item Nest Hub Max
\end{itemize}
However, due to timing constraints, testing will only be run on the most popular cases, which would include the iPhone, Pixel and Samsung phones, as well as iPad and Galaxy tablets.

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
In the current design of the product, the product shall be implemented in a cloud hosted serverless
environment. In this specific case, it shall be AWS Lambda. The product itself shall also be able
to function properly with any web browser and operating system.

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
In the current design of the product, there are no partner or collaborative applications that will
work along with the product. Therefore, there are no partner or collaborative constraints.

\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
The following off-the-shelf software will be utilized:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Next.js (and Next PWA)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment will be very broad. The product can be used from anywhere the
user has access to a device and internet to run the application.

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
As stated in the SFWRENG 4G06 course outline, the schedule constraints are as follows:
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{Schedule Constraints}
	\vspace{5pt}
	\begin{tabular}{|p{0.3\textwidth}|p{0.6\textwidth}|}

		\hline
		Mar 8, 2023     & Verification and Validation Report \\
		\hline
		Mar 20-31, 2023 & Final Demo (Rev 1)                 \\
		\hline
		Apr 5, 2023     & Final Documentation                \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The project has no monetary budget. If there are any necessary purchases for development, the cost
shall be paid by the project members and reimbursed by the supervisor. Furthermore, these purchases
may not exceed \$750.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
The project will require authentication in the form of users logging in. The current implementation
of the project will require users to authenticate with a username and password. In the future, SSO
may be used.

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

User characteristics should go under assumptions.

\subsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\subsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}

\subsection{Maintainability and Support Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirements}

\subsection{Cultural Requirements}

\subsection{Legal Requirements}

\subsection{Health and Safety Requirements}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are issues that should
be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

There are currently no known open issues that may lead to significant change to the product or its
design.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}

There are existing services that solve many of the problems that this application aims to address.
These include AutoLeap (https://autoleap.com), Sayaaraa (https://sayaaraa.com), and KUKUI
(https://www.kukui.com). These are all paid services and most offer a trial period. Additional,
these app only address the shop management aspect of the problem. Openbay (https://app.openbay.com)
is an existing application that focuses on vehicle owner's needs. This application exclusively
operates in the United States of America.

\subsubsection{Resuable Components}

There are many libraries and frameworks available that can be reused to accelerate the building
process of the application. Next.js can be used to provide a framework to build the application.
Next.js comes with many out-of-box solutions for common website development problems. NextAuth.js
is a library designed to help simplify the authentication process. Prisma is a library designed to
help simplify the communication between the application and the database. Next-PWA is a library
designed to quickly bootstrap a Next.js application into a progressive web application.

A runtime and ecosystem that is available to use is Node.js. This runtime comes with a large
ecosystem of packages that can be reused and leveraged for common application components, including
the libraries listed previously.

All components listed above are free to use for private and commercial use.

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}

There are no known products available that can be legally copied for use in this application.

\subsection{New Problems}

\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}

This application will change the way certain processes are preformed and these changes will impact
the users.

\textbf{Work Orders}

The work order system will affect the way automotive mechanics document their work. The data will
be inputted into the application therefore any failures can result in data loss.

\textbf{Appointments}

The appointments system will affect the way that both the customers and the employees schedule
appointments. The application will track daily appointment schedules and report time conflicts. The
application shall not lock the employee out of overriding the schedule.

\textbf{Quotes}

The quotes system will affect the way that both the customers and automotive repair shops
communicate in the service quotation process. The quotes will now be communicated partially or
completely through the application instead of completely in-person. Failure in this system may lead
to a loss in data.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}

The application will be completely stand alone and will not be interfacing with any existing
systems. The existing system may continue to coexist with the application at the user's discretion.

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}

Any potential adverse reactions related to using the device in which application is being launched
on (e.g., computer, mobile device, tablet, etc.) would extend to the use of this application. The
application will not introduce any new adverse reactions to the user.

\subsubsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}

The database is not able to sustain the number of connections to serve all requests.

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}

Any failures or downtime of third-party integrations may impact the overall availability and
operation of the application. These integrations include the database service provider, the email
server, and websocket provider. Additionally, this application will be dealing with user data. As
privacy laws around the world are getting stricter, there is a possibility application violates
these future laws that do not currently exist.

\subsection{Tasks}
\subsubsection{Project Planning}
The project schedule will follow the deadline for the deliverables outlined in the SFWRENG 4G06
course outline.

\begin{table}[H]

		\hline
	\end{tabular}

	\label{project_tasks}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Planning of the Development Phases}

The development of the project will be conducted in two phases:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Initial development of application and documentation
	\item Refinement of application and documentation
\end{enumerate}

Phase 1 is where the bulk of the application will be designed and implemented. The design of both
the components of the application and how the components will interact will de developed.
Additional, Phase 1 is where most of the documentation and report will be written. Phase 1 will end
with the Revision 0 Demonstration. Here the stakeholders will see the application implementation
and be able to provide feedback.

Phase 2 will be focused on refining the application and the documentation. There is expected to be
no new major feature development and instead, all efforts will be focused on incorporating the
stakeholders' feedback into the application.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
\subsubsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}

There are no requirements for migrating to the new product.

\subsubsection{Data That Has to Be Modified or Translated for the New System}

No data needs to be modified or translated to the new system.

\subsection{Risks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Failures in the work orders and quotes workflow may lead to data loss.
	\item Failures in the appointments workflow may lead to a loss in appointment or conflicting
	      appointments.
	\item Failure to meet deadlines will cause setbacks in project's timeline. In the event of this, lower
	      priority requirements may need to be dropped.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}

There are no financial costs associated with the development of this application. All software and
cloud infrastructure used are free to use. There will be about six months of development time
required.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}

The application will feature a ``Getting Started'' guide, where it shall guide the user through the
most common use cases. For vehicle owners, the use cases will include: searching for shops,
requesting quotes, and scheduling appointments. For automotive shops, the use cases include:
setting shop details, managing appointments, managing employees, responding to quotes, and managing
work orders.

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}

Knowledge of how to navigate a website will be required. Documentation concerning detailed usage of
the website's user flows will be provided to the user.

\subsection{Waiting Room}

There are currently no requirements that are not part of the initial release.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

During the requirements collection and understanding phase, there were also ideas on how to
implement the solution.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Form
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item With the constraint that this application to be a PWA, the idea of using a React-based framework,
		            specifically Next.js.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Authentication
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item To handle authentication, using emails and passwords, with the package NextAuth.js.
		      \item Creating a dedicated endpoint in the backend for looking up user information.
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

	when filing in the template.}

\noindent \plt{Grammar, flow and \LaTeX advice:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For Mac users \texttt{*.DS\_Store} should be in \texttt{.gitignore}
		\item \LaTeX{} and formatting rules
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Variables are italic, everything else not, includes subscripts (link to document)
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item \href{https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf}{Conventions}

			            \end{itemize}
			      \item Use BibTeX
			      \item Use cross-referencing
		      \end{itemize}
		\item Grammar and writing rules
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Acronyms expanded on first usage (not just in table of acronyms)
			      \item ``In order to'' should be ``to''
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}}

\noindent \plt{Advice on using the template:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Difference between physical and software constraints
		\item Properties of a correct solution means \emph{additional} properties, not a restating of the
		      requirements (may be ``not applicable'' for your problem). If you have a table of output
		      constraints, then these are properties of a correct solution.
		\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
		\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
		\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of reference by fields as
		      automatically generatable
		\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your requirement could be more abstract
	\end{itemize}
}
\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the graduate attribute
of Lifelong Learning. Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete this
	      capstone project? Examples of possible knowledge to acquire include domain specific knowledge from
	      the domain of your application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
	      computer science knowledge. Skills may be related to technology, or writing, or presentation, or
	      team management, etc. You should look to identify at least one item for each team member.

	      \textbf{Arkin Modi}

	      \dots

	      \textbf{Joy Xiao}
	      One skill I would like to improve is team management because this is a large project which we have to manage by ourselves and pace ourselves for the whole school year.
	      \dots

	      \textbf{Leon So}

	      \dots

	      \textbf{Timothy Choy}

	      \dots

	\item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least
	      two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill? Of the identified approaches,
	      which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

	      \textbf{Arkin Modi}

	      \dots

	      \textbf{Joy Xiao}
	      The first approach to master team management would be to keep track of the tasks and deadlines and plan
	      meeting agendas in advance. Another approach is to give adequate time for team members to complete their
	      tasks and give extra time in case an unknown issue arises. This will help us keep on schedule so we don't
	      miss a deadline. I chose this skill because I think it would be very useful to have when working at a
	      company.

	      \dots

	      \textbf{Leon So}

	      \dots

	      \textbf{Timothy Choy}
