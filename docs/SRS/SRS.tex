\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

Independent auto repair shops do not have an efficient way of reaching and interacting with new
customers. Currently, many independent shop owners rely on word-of-mouth referrals as a main
channel to acquiring new customers. Independent auto repair shops are also spending a significant
amount of their time on administrative work such as managing appointments and providing quotes. As
a result, independent auto repair shops have a difficult time competing with larger repair shops
which have dedicated systems and services in place.

On the other hand, customers do not have an effective way to find and compare auto repair shops.
Currently, one of the only ways to compare repair shops is by manually searching or reaching out to
repair shops one-by-one. This process can often be repetitive and time-consuming.

Sayyara is a progressive web application (PWA) which will act as a single platform for independent
auto repair shops and vehicle owners. This platform will allow independent auto repair shops and
vehicle owners to interact in a more efficient and effective manner. Vehicle owners can search for
auto repair shops and services based on a variety of search filters; request quotes for service;
book, view, and manage service appointments. On the application, auto repair shop owners will have
full shop management capabilities such as: adding and managing a list of employees; managing a list
of service types and corresponding service appointment availabilities; managing store information
such as location, hours of operation, and contact information. Auto repair shop owners and
employees will be able to manage quotes, service appointments, and work orders from a single
application. Ultimately, Sayyara will significantly improve the auto repair experience for both
independent auto repair shops and vehicle owners.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The client of the project is Nabeel Ibrahim. Nabeel will be the point of contact throughout the
development of the project.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers of Sayyara will be independent auto repair shop owners, shop employees, and vehicle
owners who are looking for a vehicle repair or maintenance service.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders of the project are the developers, Tiny Coders, who are designing and
implementing the project.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}
\emph{Description:} The product shall be built as a Progressive Web Application (PWA)\\
\emph{Rationale:} The supervisor wants the application to be a PWA\\
\emph{Fit Criterion:} The product shall be written using the Next.js PWA plugin

\emph{Description:} The product shall be able to function on a variety of devices, such as on a computer, on tablets and on most modern phones\\
\emph{Rationale:} Users will be accessing this product in a variety of scenarios, and will have access to different devices\\
\emph{Fit Criterion:} The product shall be tested to function properly on Chrome's device toolbar, which includes the following devices:
\begin{itemize}
	\item iPhone SE
	\item iPhone XR

\end{itemize}
However, due to timing constraints, testing will only be run on the most popular cases, which would include the iPhone, Pixel and Samsung phones, as well as iPad and Galaxy tablets.

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
In the current design of the product, the product shall be implemented in a cloud hosted serverless
environment. In this specific case, it shall be AWS Lambda. The product itself shall also be able
to function properly with any web browser and operating system.

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
In the current design of the product, there are no partner or collaborative applications that will
work along with the product. Therefore, there are no partner or collaborative constraints.

\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
The following off-the-shelf software will be utilized:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Next.js (and Next PWA)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
The anticipated workplace environment will be very broad. The product can be used from anywhere the
user has access to a device and internet to run the application.

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
As stated in the SFWRENG 4G06 course outline, the schedule constraints are as follows:
\begin{table}[H]

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The project has no monetary budget. If there are any necessary purchases for development, the cost
shall be paid by the project members and reimbursed by the supervisor. Furthermore, these purchases
may not exceed \$750.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
The project will require authentication in the form of users logging in. The current implementation
of the project will require users to authenticate with a username and password. In the future, SSO
may be used.

\noindent \plt{The following is not part of the template, just some things to consider
	when filing in the template.}

\noindent \plt{Grammar, flow and \LaTeX advice:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For Mac users \texttt{*.DS\_Store} should be in \texttt{.gitignore}
		\item \LaTeX{} and formatting rules
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Variables are italic, everything else not, includes subscripts (link to document)
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item \href{https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf}{Conventions}
				            \item Watch out for implied multiplication
			            \end{itemize}
			      \item Use BibTeX
			      \item Use cross-referencing
		      \end{itemize}
		\item Grammar and writing rules
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Acronyms expanded on first usage (not just in table of acronyms)
			      \item ``In order to'' should be ``to''
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}}

\noindent \plt{Advice on using the template:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Difference between physical and software constraints
		\item Properties of a correct solution means \emph{additional} properties, not a restating of the
		      requirements (may be ``not applicable'' for your problem). If you have a table of output
		      constraints, then these are properties of a correct solution.
		\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
		\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
		\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of reference by fields as
		      automatically generatable
		\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your requirement could be more abstract
	\end{itemize}
}
\section{Appendix}

This section has been added to the Volere template. This is where you can place additional
information.

\subsection{Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the graduate attribute
of Lifelong Learning. Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete this
	      capstone project? Examples of possible knowledge to acquire include domain specific knowledge from
	      the domain of your application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
	      computer science knowledge. Skills may be related to technology, or writing, or presentation, or
	      team management, etc. You should look to identify at least one item for each team member.
	\item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least
	      two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill? Of the identified approaches,
	      which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS. Their values are
defined in this section for easy maintenance.
