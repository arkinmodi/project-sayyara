\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

Sayyara is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) which acts as a single platform for independent auto
repair shops and vehicle owners. This platform allows independent auto repair shops and vehicle
owners to interact in various ways. Using Sayyara, vehicle owners can search for auto repair shops
and services based on a variety of search filters; request quotes for service; book, view, and
manage service appointments. On the application, auto repair shop owners have full shop management
capabilities such as: adding and managing a list of employees; managing a list of service types and
corresponding service appointment availabilities; managing store information such as location,
hours of operation, and contact information. Auto repair shop owners and employees will be able to
manage quotes, service appointments, and work orders from a single application.

\subsection{Objectives}

The objective of the testing outlined in this document is to demonstrate adequate usability and
ensure that the system is in a functional state for the end users. The testing and validation will
also aid in ensuring that the product fulfills the system requirements, intended use, and goals of
stakeholders.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
	and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
	can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
	is done, they will be written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
	come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

The verification and validation team will consist of the core developers (Joy Xiao, Tim Choy, Leon
So, Arkin Modi), as well as the course instructor and TAs.

The developers are responsible for coming up with tests with suitable edge cases to evaluate the
correctness of Sayyara. The developers will all be responsible for writing and executing all test
cases listed in the document and taking note of the results. The developers will ensure that
Sayyara passes all tests after performing the tests and making any necessary updates.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
	ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for
	something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

Design verification will be done by the core developers of the project. The design will also be
reviewed by the TAs of the course. The design of the system will be verified by going through the
requirements from the
\href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software
	Requirements Specification (SRS)} and determining whether the outputs correspond with the expected
inputs. The verification will also be done by going through the
\href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/Design/MG/MG.pdf}{Module Guide
	(MG)} and
\href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/Design/MIS/MIS.pdf}{Module
	Interface Specification (MIS)} checklist and ensure that all the modules are completed and fulfill
the corresponding requirements.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be verified.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

Automated integration tests will be created to fullfil the system tests defined in section
\ref{System Test Description} and automated unit tests will be created to fullfil the tests defined
in section \ref{Unit Test Description}. Static analysis will be performed through code review by at
least one core team member per pull request and automation tools as stated in \ref{Automated
	Testing and Verification Tools}. A pull request will cover at most one module.

Manual System Tests defined in section \ref{System Test Description} shall take place from January
16, 2023 to January 30, 2023. The areas of responsibility will be divided as described in table
\ref{Manual System Testing Responsibilities}.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools} \label{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

All tooling and automations that will be used for testing and verification have been documented in
the
\href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development
	Plan} under the ``Technology'' and ``Code Standard'' sections.

As part of our CI, we will have a pipeline running the automated tests against every commit to the
main branch and every pull request opened against the main branch that contains a source code or
testing code change. There will also be a pipeline running against every pull request asserting
adherence to the documented code style standards. Code coverage reports will be commented directly
to the pull request or the commit to the main branch using a pipeline.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

The plan for validating the software and the requirements shall be to conduct review session with
the stakeholders. These review sessions shall focus on the business events and user flows as
defined in the \href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}.

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
	appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
	reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
	necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
	survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
	format for the tests given below.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
	requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description} \label{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
	philosophy for test case selection.}
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
	document) has been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
	developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
	verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
	have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
	explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
	appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
	technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
	References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
	perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
	tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item{test-id1\\}

	Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will be automatic}

	Initial State:

	Input:

	Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

	Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

	How test will be performed:

	\item{test-id2\\}

	Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will be automatic}

	Initial State:

	Input:

	Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

	Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

	How test will be performed:

	\item{...\\}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
	performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
	nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
	mentioned functional tests.}

\subsubsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{NFRT-UH1} % For UH1

	      Type: Dynamic, Manual

	      How test will be performed: The testers will complete the manual system tests for functional
	      requirements listed section \ref{Tests for Functional Requirements} on a MacOS desktop/laptop
	      device, a Windows desktop/laptop, an iOS mobile device, and an android mobile device.

	\item \textbf{NFRT-UH2} % For UH2

	      Type: Dynamic, Manual

	      Initial State: Device is connected to the internet and application is not open

	      Input/Condition: The user launches the application on Google Chrome

	      Output/Result: The system can be assessed through Google Chrome

	      How test will be performed: The tester will attempt to launch the application on the Google Chrome
	      web browser and using a device that is connected to the internet.

	\item \textbf{NFRT-UH3} % For UH3

	      Type: Dynamic, Manual

	      Initial State: Device is connected to the internet and the application is open

	      Input/Condition: User disconnects from the internet

	      Output/Result: The system notifies the user that there is no network connection and functionality
	      will be limited.

	      How test will be performed: The tester disconnect from the internet while the application is open.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Operational and Environmental Requirements}
\begin{enumerate}

	\item \textbf{NFRT-OE1} % For OE1

	      Type: Dynamic, Manual

	      How test will be performed: The testers will complete the manual system tests for functional
	      requirements listed section \ref{Tests for Functional Requirements} on Google Chrome using various
	      device dimension options listed the Google DevTools Device Toolbar. At minimum, the testers will
	      test with the following dimensions: Responsive, iPhone 12 Pro (390x844), iPhone SE (375x667), and
	      iPad Air (820x1180). This set will provide a reasonable variety of different device dimensions.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the graduate attribute
of Lifelong Learning. Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to successfully complete the
	      verification and validation of your project? Examples of possible knowledge and skills include
	      dynamic testing knowledge, static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc. You should look to
	      identify at least one item for each team member.
	\item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous question, what are at least
	      two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or mastering the skill? Of the identified approaches,
	      which will each team member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
