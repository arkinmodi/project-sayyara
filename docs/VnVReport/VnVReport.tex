\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Summary}

Sayyara is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) which acts as a single platform for independent auto
repair shops and vehicle owners. This platform allows independent auto repair shops and vehicle
owners to interact in various ways. Using Sayyara, vehicle owners can search for auto repair shops
and services based on a variety of search filters; request quotes for service; book, view, and
manage service appointments. On the application, auto repair shop owners have full shop management
capabilities such as: adding and managing a list of employees; managing a list of service types and
corresponding service appointment availabilities; managing store information such as location,
hours of operation, and contact information. Auto repair shop owners and employees will be able to
manage quotes, service appointments, and work orders from a single application.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}
This document outlines the validation and verification process for the application, Sayyara, and a
detailed summary of results for the planned tests defined in the
\href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{VnV Plan}.

\subsection{Scope of Testing}
As defined in the
\href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{VnV Plan},
the tests reported aim to verify and validate functional and nonfunctional requirements listed in
the \href{https://github.com/arkinmodi/project-sayyara/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}.

In addition, the testing reported in this document aims to validate that the application provides
adequate usability and to verify that system is in a functional state for the end users. The
testing and validation will aid in ensuring that the product fulfills the system requirements,
intended use, and goals of stakeholders.

	      requirements.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Unit Testing}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from
	the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular
	the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users)
	should be highlighted.}

\section{Automated Testing}

All automated testing was carried out by Jest, a JavaScript testing framework. Each module has its
own corresponding test file located within the ``test'' folder. The ``test'' folder has the same
structure as the ``src'' folder, creating a one-to-one mapping of a module and its corresponding
test. For example, the module ``src/server/services/userService.ts'' has its tests located in
``test/server/services/userService.ts''. There are two Jest test runs, with the only difference
being whether the testing environment is connected to a real database or not (i.e., whether the
database needs to be seeded or mocked in each test case). As part of the CI/CD pipeline, the full
test suite is run and information regarding pass/fail and code coverage is reported on every pull
request to the main branch and to every push to the main branch.

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the graduate attribute
of Reflection. Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different from the activities that were
	      actually conducted for VnV? If there were differences, what changes required the modification in
	      the plan? Why did these changes occur? Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
	      projects? If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly predict a feasible
	      amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the evidence that demonstrates the required
	      quality? (It is expected that most teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
